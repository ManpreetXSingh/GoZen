# Contributing to GoZen
Thank you for considering contributing to the GoZen project, all help is greatly appreciated! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the GoZen project. Please take a moment to review the information below, before making any contributions.

## Project overview
GoZen is an open-source video editor developed using the Godot game engine (version 4.4+, we try to follow the latest stable version). The primary languages used are GDScript and C++. The project is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license, this is due to using FFmpeg with the GPL licensed codec support which is required for the encoding of videos. GoZen will stay open-source under the GPL license, even if we end up moving away from FFmpeg since most libraries for handling video files fall under this license. 

## Getting started
To contribute to GoZen, make sure you have the following:
- [Latest stable version of Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/);
- [Familiarity with GDScript and Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/);

Not required but could be helpful:
- Video file/format knowledge;
- Audio file knowledge;
- GDExtension knowledge;
- Familiarity with C++;

## How to contribute
1. [Fork the project on GitHub to create your own copy](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/GoZen/fork);
1. Create a new branch in your forked repository with a descriptive name for the changes you plan on making;
1. [Open a pull request from your branch to the main repository](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/GoZen/compare);
1. Wait for code review and feedback from the project maintainer (you will be notified through the pull request);
1. Address any feedback or requested changes and update your pull request;
1. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

If you want to work on multiple things at once, please create multiple branches as merging these changes will otherwise become more difficult to differentiate.

### Reporting bugs and requesting features
For bug reports and feature requests, please follow the guidelines below:

**Bug Reports:** Provide a clear and detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it.
**Feature Requests:** Clearly explain the desired feature and its expected benefits.

### Translation contribution
At this moment there is no translation contributions necessary due to the very early stage at which the editor is at right now. This will come in the future!
