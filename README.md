## What is GoZen?
GoZen is a minimalistic video editor. Not too many bells and whistles, with the aim of being a stable and performant editor. GoZen is being build for Linux, but there is also Windows support.

### Meaning of GoZen
I named the editor GoZen, **Go** comes from Godot and **Zen** from ... zen. The name implies that the video editor is made in Godot, and that it's a _zen_ experience to use. 午前 (= Gozen) also means morning in Japanese, that's why the logo represents a rising sun. I'm quite a morning person and seeing the sunrise always makes me feel like I'll have a productive day, so the meaning of GoZen for me links to being productive and having a zen experience.
